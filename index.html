                                ill write some stuff about myself here tho, growing up i played piano(grade 7) and cello(grade 3), i wasnt very sporty growing up and only started doing things like gym
                                and bouldering when i was 17, in my first year of college, i started watching anime when i was like 13, and moved on to manga around 15.

                                <hr color="black">
                                education - i went to dixie grammer junior school and then dixie grammar school in market bosworth all from 4 up to i was 16, then i moved to bosworth academy for college, where
                                i met my current friends. then ofcourse, i went to DMU in leicester, where i met you :). best choice of my life, it really was

                                i enjoy playing games alot of course, as you know, and i dont really do much nowadays besides playing games, going to univeristy classes, and going to work at a takeaway.
                                i hope to be able to get out of working at a takeaway and going to a big job at an IT company or even better yet, a games company and proceed with my dreams of creating games :))
                                but for that, i will have to be a hard worker, and i will try to get to my goals. i really miss you.

                                i have picked up a few hobbies over time, like in 2024, i started going golfing, and been going go karting quite a few times with my cousins and my friends like ethan.
                                its really fun, i wish you could've watched me do those things in person.

                                i dont know what else to write, i struggle with knowing my own things actually, and i hated it, because you wanted me to talk more about myself
                                and i struggled alot
                                <hr color="black">
                                im actually crying while typing this all up, and it does hurt, because i know you have alot going on, and i understand, and what we are, i know it hurts, it bloody hurts.
                                i really miss you and i dont know what to do with myself, but you said you will block me, but i hope you dont do it in the morning so we can talk the last bit we ever can.
                                and this is the last thing i can even give you. to let you keep a small connection with me, even past the soul ties, soul mates, and connections we have. i just dont know what to
                                do anymore

                                okay, youved blocked me now at 22:20, we did argue about the smoking between me and you, and well, i guess i was pushing you, i dont know if i was pushing you to say something, i wasnt, i was just being mean. and now youved blocked me.
                                probably for the best. well, if you do look at this ever like, ever. you'll see this, and. im sorry. i think you telling me youre going to block me makes me more emotional and makes me cry alot, than if you just do it. so i guess thats good.
                                and now youre a bit more free from me and having to wait until you arrive safely at your next country for me to do it myself. so thats good for you, i think. i know we both said we dont want to argue, and you ask if i could stop pushing you to
                                say things, i guess i did keep pushing you to say things by being mean. im really sorry. i just, if you do read this, im sorry.
